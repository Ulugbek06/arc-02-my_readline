The code you provided appears to be a C program that reads a file line by line using a custom implementation of the my_readline function. Here's a README explaining the code:

# File Line Reader
This program reads a file line by line and prints each line to the console. It uses a custom implementation of the my_readline function.

# Compilation
To compile the program, use a C compiler such as gcc:

# Usage
The program expects the name of the file to read as a command-line argument. Here's an example of how to run it:

./file_line_reader input.txt
Replace input.txt with the name of the file you want to read.

# Code Explanation
The code consists of several functions:

# my_realloc: 
This function reallocates memory for a given buffer of a specified size. It creates a new buffer, copies the contents of the old buffer into it, and then frees the old buffer. The new buffer is returned.

# n_spliter:
 This function reads characters from Storege_of_file (the file storage) until it encounters a newline character (\n). It dynamically allocates memory for a string and returns it. It keeps track of the current position using the flag variable.

# my_readline:
 This function opens the file specified by the input name using the open system call. It reads the file in chunks of Readline_Read_Size bytes and appends the contents to Storege_of_file. The function then calls n_spliter to extract the next line from Storege_of_file and returns it.

# main:
 The program's entry point. It calls my_readline in a loop until there are no more lines to read. Each line is printed to the console using printf. The flag variable is reset, and memory allocated for buf and Storege_of_file is freed.

# Limitations
The program assumes that the file exists and can be opened for reading.

It reads the file in chunks of fixed size (Readline_Read_Size) and dynamically grows the buffer to accommodate the file contents. This approach may not be memory-efficient for very large files.

The program does not handle errors that may occur during file operations or memory allocation.

It does not handle special characters or encoding considerations.

The program assumes the file contains newline-separated lines.
